# Mall-Customer-Segmentation-Clustering-Using-Python

## Project Description:
The goal of this project was to assist the marketing team in understanding the target customers better and to design tailored campaigns for different customer segments. The task involved segmenting mall customers into distinct groups based on age, annual income, and spending score. By identifying these customer clusters, the marketing team could develop customized strategies that cater to the unique needs of each group, improving campaign efficiency and overall customer satisfaction.

## Objective:
To perform customer segmentation by analyzing demographic and behavioral data using the K-Means clustering algorithm, enabling targeted marketing campaigns for the identified customer segments. The key objective was to divide the market into subsets based on customers' age, income, and spending score.

## Project Execution:
### 1.Data Preprocessing & Exploration:
The dataset containing 200 customers' details (age, gender, annual income, and spending score) was imported and analyzed using Python.
Univariate and bivariate analyses were performed to understand the distributions and relationships between different variables (Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score). Various visualizations (scatter plots, box plots, distribution plots) were used to identify patterns.

### 2.K-Means Clustering:
The K-Means algorithm was employed to segment the customers. The Elbow Method was used to determine the optimal number of clusters for different features.
Two clustering approaches were used: univariate (clustering based on income) and bivariate (based on both income and spending score).

### 3.Cluster Analysis:
The characteristics of each cluster were examined to understand the typical profile of customers in each segment, such as income ranges, spending behaviors, and age distribution.

### 4.Summary Statistics & Visualizations:
Clusters were analyzed using summary statistics (mean and distribution across clusters). These were visualized using pair plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps.
